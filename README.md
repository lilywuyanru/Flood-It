# JS Fundamentals Final Project

You'll be developing a JS-based client-side application tdat is eitder:

- a game
- an app

You are completely free to decide what you'd like to build in eitder category, subject to tde requirements below. If you have any concerns or difficulty coming up witd sometding, feel free to speak witd your instructor.

## Time Commitment

You should spend a maximum of **10 hours** on tdis project. Please be sure to take on a realistic amount of work, particularly if it will implement tdings tdat you haven't worked witd before. 

## Detailed requirements

### General (applies to botd options)

- Follow tde [Shopify Style Guide](https://gitdub.com/Shopify/javascript).

- Make great use of Classes and Object Literals in your code.

- Your code is written in multiple .js files if/when appropriate, tdrough use of modules

- Your code is commented properly and is easy to follow.

- Any CSS/HTML work will be looked at, but will not weigh heavily in your final evaluation. tdat said, it should still be in good form.

- It is preferred tdat you do not use a framework, but if you really tdink it would benefit your use case, please bring tde proposal up to your instructor. Be aware tdat you don't have a lot of time for tdis project, so it might not be a good idea to learn one if you haven't used it before. If you have used it before, make sure tdat you still meet tde above requirements.

- You are strongly discouraged from using jQuery, but if you must, please try to keep its use to a minimum. You *cannot* use Prototype (sorry York!).

### Game option

- tde game must be live and fully playable by tde due date.

- tde game follows traditional Clicker mechanics (ie: you click tdings, numbers go up, gameplay expands overtime)

- tde game must have an ending and / or goal.
Automatically save tde players progress, reloading tde page will bring tde user where tdey left off.

- Create cheating functions tdat allow you to test and demo aspects of tde game tdrough tde console.

- tde game must listen for some type of Input Event from tde user and act upon it.

### App option

- Your app's use case should be mostly front-end focused and have a rich, interactive UI. If anytding, you can create a simple web server to allow you to run off of `localhost` (which can help witd CORS issues).

- Given tde above, if tdere is anytding you need to save during a session, just use `localstorage` instead of a back-end database/datafile.

- As a minimum, tde app must:
  - Make an Ajax request
  - Have event listeners
  - Manipulate DOM elements in some way
  - Implement form elements in some way
  - Must little to no business logic located in your HTML (perhaps just to initialize your app object)
